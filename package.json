  "description": "**Machtiani** employs a clever document retrieval algorithm that reduces the total code file search to improve efficiency. It can find the right context, out of hundreds (and more) of code files, to answer your prompts. It works unreasonably well. The motivation for building this was out of fustration with chat services that claim to work with an existing codebase but are totally unusable because they all use the same tired strategy of chunking, embedding, and returning trash results. Machtiani feels very native and coupled to the code you point it at. The aim is to support models aside from OpenAI, including open-source and self-hosted options.",
